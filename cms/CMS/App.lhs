\section{The App Monad}
\label{App}

When I wrote the first version of Vocabulink, many functions passed around a
database connection. I now understand monads a little bit more, and it's easier
to store some information within an ``App'' monad. This reduces our function
signatures a little bit.

> module CMS.App (             App, AppEnv(..), AppT, runApp, logApp, getOption,
>                              output404, reversibleRedirect,
>                              queryTuple', queryValue', queryAttribute',
>                              queryTuples', quickInsertNo', runStmt', quickStmt',
>                              withTransaction', run',
>  {- Control.Monad.Reader -}  asks) where

> import CMS.CGI
> import CMS.DB
> import CMS.Utils

> import Control.Applicative

> data AppEnv = AppEnv {  appDB          :: Connection,

The App monad is a combination of the CGI and Reader monads.

> newtype AppT m a = AppT (ReaderT AppEnv (CGIT m) a)
>   deriving (Monad, MonadIO, MonadReader AppEnv)

...whose CGI monad uses the IO monad.

> type App a = AppT IO a

> instance Applicative (AppT IO) where
>   pure = return
>   (<*>) = ap

> instance Functor (AppT IO) where
>   fmap = liftM

To make the App monad an instance of MonadCGI, we need to define basic CGI
functions. CGI is relatively simple and its functionality can be defined on top
of just an environment getter and a function for adding headers. We reuse the
existing methods.

> instance MonadCGI (AppT IO) where
>   cgiAddHeader n v = AppT $ lift $ cgiAddHeader n v
>   cgiGet x = AppT $ lift $ cgiGet x

|runApp| does the job of creating the Reader environment and returning the
CGIResult from within the App monad to the CGI monad.

> runApp :: Connection -> ConfigParser -> App CGIResult -> CGI CGIResult
> runApp c cp (AppT a) = do
>   res <- runReaderT a $ AppEnv {  appDB          = c,
>                                   appCP          = cp }
>   return res

At some point it's going to be essential to have all errors and notices logged
in 1 location. For now, the profusion of monads and exception handlers makes
this difficult.

> logApp :: String -> String -> App (String)
> logApp t s = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ logMsg c t s

\subsection{Convenience Functions}

Here are some functions that abstract away even having to ask for the
environment in the App monad.

When we direct a user to the some page, we might want to make sure that they
can find their way back to where they were. To do so, we get the current URI
and append it to the target page in the query string. The receiving page might
know what to do with it.

> reversibleRedirect :: String -> App String
> reversibleRedirect path = do
>   request <- fromMaybe "/" `liftM` getVar "REQUEST_URI"
>   return $ path ++ "?redirect=" ++ escapeURIString isUnescapedInURI request

We want to log 404 errors in the database, as they may indicate a problem or
opportunity with the site. This takes a list of Strings that are stored in the
log. It outputs to the user the request URI.

> output404 :: [String] -> App CGIResult
> output404 s = do  logApp "404" (show s)
>                   outputNotFound $ intercalate "/" s

\subsubsection{Database}

When we're dealing with the database, there's always a chance we're going to
have some sort of error (there's a seemingly infinite number of possible
sources). We don't want the entire page to blow up if there are. Also, we don't
really care what the cause of the error is at the time of execution. SQL errors
are not something you can generally recover from. We just need to log the
error, return some sort of error indicator to the calling function (in this
case, Nothing), and get on with it.

In many cases, the calling function will still need to do data validation
anyway (make sure that a list of the expected size is returned, etc), so the
extra Maybe wrapper shouldn't be much extra trouble. In fact, in some cases
it's much easier than manually wrapping the query with |catchSql|.

> queryTuple' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe [SqlValue])
> queryTuple' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (queryTuple c sql vs >>= return . Just) `catchSqlD` Nothing

> queryTuples' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe [[SqlValue]])
> queryTuples' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (quickQuery' c sql vs >>= return . Just) `catchSqlD` Nothing

> queryValue' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe SqlValue)
> queryValue' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (queryValue c sql vs) `catchSqlD` Nothing

> queryAttribute' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe [SqlValue])
> queryAttribute' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (queryAttribute c sql vs >>= return . Just) `catchSqlD` Nothing

> quickInsertNo' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> String -> App (Maybe Integer)
> quickInsertNo' sql vs seqname = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ quickInsertNo c sql vs seqname `catchSqlD` Nothing

> runStmt' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe Integer)
> runStmt' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (run c sql vs >>= return . Just) `catchSqlD` Nothing

It may seem strange to return Maybe (), but we want to know if the database
change succeeded.

> quickStmt' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Maybe ())
> quickStmt' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ (quickStmt c sql vs >>= return . Just) `catchSqlD` Nothing

Working with transactions outside of the App monad can be done, but we might as
well make a version that fits with the rest of the style of the program (logs
the exception and returns Nothing).

> withTransaction' :: App a -> App (Maybe a)
> withTransaction' actions = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   r <- tryApp actions
>   case r of
>     Right x  -> do  liftIO $ commit c
>                     return $ Just x
>     Left e   -> do  logApp "exception" $ show e
>                     liftIO (try (rollback c) :: IO (Either SomeException ())) -- Discard any exception here
>                     return Nothing

> run' :: String -> [SqlValue] -> App (Integer)
> run' sql vs = do
>   c <- asks appDB
>   liftIO $ run c sql vs

\subsubsection{Exceptions}

|tryApp| is like |tryCGI|. It allows us to catch exceptions within the App
monad. To do so, we unwrap the Reader monad and use TryCGI (which unwraps
another Reader and Writer).

> tryApp :: App a -> App (Either SomeException a)
> tryApp (AppT c) = AppT (ReaderT (tryCGI' . runReaderT c))

\subsubsection{Configuration}

Return a configuration option or log an error.

This always pulls from the DEFAULT section. It also only supports strings.

> getOption :: String -> App (Maybe String)
> getOption option = do
>   cp <- asks appCP
>   opt <- runErrorT $ get cp "DEFAULT" option
>   case opt of
>     Left e   -> logApp "config" (show e) >> return Nothing
>     Right o  -> return $ Just o
