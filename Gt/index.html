<p>Gt is Ecclesia RPG's official user interface (and more) library (written in standard C++).  The reason for its creation is to simplify programming for everyone working on core components while still maintaining a high level of portability.  Coincidentally it's going to find use in all of the support programs and utilities that Ecclesia RPG will need to use (such as a terrain editor and animation sequencer).</p>

<p>Currently Gt provides for the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>an SDL surface abstraction with a few primitives (set pixel, draw line, clear, etc)</li>
<li>direct rendering of TrueType (and other) fonts through the use of the freetype library</li>
<li>an object-oriented widget heirarchy</li>
<li>a callback system to improve the flexibility of the widgets</li>
<li>a group of exceptions to simplify error handling</li>
</ul></p>

<p>At this time the widget heirarchy is in active development and much more widgets will be added soon.  The font code has stabilized and is not expected to change drastically.  The callback system is still relatively experimental, but fully functional, and the exception classes and Surface class are evolving all the time.</p>

<p>As Gt is currently only at version 0.1.7 it is only recommended for Ecclesia RPG developer use (although there are no known bugs at this time).  A tarball of version 0.1.7 can be found <a href="Gt-0.1.7.tar.gz">here</a>, and the most up-to-date version (recommended) can be checked out from CVS by following the instructions listed <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=17329">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gt should compile with no changes to the source on GNU/Linux, win32, BeOS, MacOS, and possibly others.  It has only been extensively tested on GNU/Linux, but it has been determined to run under a win32 environment also.</p>

<p>As an exercise in learning the UML, jcore has created a few diagrams of Gt in its current state (as of 0.1.1).  Be warned that these provide only a very narrow view into Gt and that they're probably not correctly modeled.  Having said that...</p>
<ul><li><a href="diagrams/use_case_0.1.1.png">Use Case Diagram</a></li>
<li><a href="diagrams/interaction_0.1.1.png">Interaction (events) Diagram</a></li>
<li><a href="diagrams/class_0.1.1.png">Class Diagram</a></li></ul>
<p>All diagrams were created with <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/">Dia</a>.  jcore will be working on a large batch of diagrams for Gt 0.2 to aid in development, and you can expect those to give a much more mature and broad view.</p>
